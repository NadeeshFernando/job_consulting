Online job consulting project

Scenario

The Jobs is a leading consultation Centre in Colombo. They provide free consultation services to job seekers who are planning to go abroad for jobs The Centre has a set of job consultants specialized on country and the type of job on which the job seekers need advice. All the consultants of the Centre are working on part time basis. The job seekers can make the appointments to the consultants by making a phone call to the reception, email or by visiting the Centre.  The Centre needs to record and keep the following details.
	The consultants details including their available dates and times.
	The job seekers detail.
	The consultant – job seekers appointment details.
Currently all the records are stored manually in paper based systems. However since the number of job seekers being consulted has been increased, the management has decided to have a Web based system to give a better service to the job seekers. Most importantly the system must have the facility to schedule appointment online as well as to produce “on demand “reports to management for efficient and effective decision making.


Provide a well-designed, user friendly system addressing the following features:
•	System should have differential access rights to the system users.
•	Interactive user friendly interfaces
•	Clear implementation of the business flow via the system.
•	Design & implement suitable sets of reports, which you think will add more value to the entire business
•	Use test driven development and include test classes to test your application
